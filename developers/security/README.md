## Monitoring

Pareto’s protocols are secured by the [Hypernative Platform](https://www.hypernative.io/), which provides real-time monitoring and protection to prevent fund losses. The system detects and mitigates cyberattacks, automatically pausing on-chain smart contracts (see _Pauser_ under [..](../../ "mention")) before any assets are compromised.&#x20;

Continuous surveillance extends to the front end, smart contract vulnerabilities, private keys, and multi-signature wallets.
